This editor does not support Grow Lancer Character Class. After editing GL in Essential, character class code is changed to "0".
In order to change the class code back to Grow Lancer/Mirage Lancer, open Character table
in MuOnline database ( using SQL Management Tool ) and edit "Class" column for chosen character:

* Grow Lancer - 112
* Mirage Lancer - 114
